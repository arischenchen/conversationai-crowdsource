This is because prior to 1948 Burmese independence, Rohingyas were known as Indians in British Burma.

It's important to distinguish that Rohinygas are not ethnically similar to most Burmese, but they do claim Burma as their homeland given the long history of settlements (claimed from the 8th century). :Reports are stating there are \"Hindu Rohingya\", like here in the The Guardian. You may note that Rohingyas are often called a \"largely Muslim minority\", hence the small remaining proportion are Hindus.

All the issues are listed below.\u2022Number of Penalties attempted - Tommy Bell for London Irish was listed as (5/5), Tom Heathcote of Worcester and Harry Mallinder of Northampton were both Listed as (1/1) when all three players also missed one penalty. There is no point listing the number of penalties a player has attempted if you are just going to assume that they didn't miss any, it would be better just to write the number scored and not put the number attempted if people aren't making sure that the number attempted is correct.\u2022What was scored - Just reading through you could see that the information was incorrect as the scores didn't add up. George Ford was listed as having scored two conversions which would have taken Leicester's score to 25 points, when he only scored one conversion and Leicester ended up on 23 points. The score for the Saracens vs Northampton Game was listed as 55\u201321, instead of 55\u201324. In the same match, Harry Mallinder's conversions were listed as penalties and penalties listed as drop goals and one of Alex Lozowski's conversions was listed as being scored by Ben Spencer. For Harlequins against London Irish, the conversion attempts were recorded as penalty attempts, and Marcus Smith's sucsessful penalty attempt was not listed at all.\u2022Minute that score took place - This one isn't as big an issue but the majority of the scores were listed as one minute out from when they were officially recorded.If you are filling out this information, please visit http://www.premiershiprugby.com/live-match-centre/ and go through the match before you update as the correct information is listed there in full.

It's no issue to me (and I will not argue the point), but I couldn't believe that those edit notes make any worthwhile difference. My logic is as follows:* There are those who are familiar with editing tables and for whom the edit summary is distracting.* There are those who are not as familiar with editing tables, but try and notice that they've messed up the table, and then figure out how to fix it.* There are those who are unfamiliar with editing tables and would not notice that they'd messed it up but happen to take note of the edit note. But then they would probably mess up the table in other ways at the same time, even if they'd taken note of the edit note.* There are those who just don't pay attention to anything, including the edit note.The edit note usefully addresses only the subset of the third bullet who did not mess up the table in any other way. Also, editors do not stay in that category for long (they tend to move up the list fairly fast), and the edit rate of this table is probably not high, especially since the less experienced editors probably do not make many edits to the MoS (at least edits that will not be reverted in their entirety anyway).

Time magazine, quoted in the article, may put it best to respond to the question of reaction: \"What makes this Pope so important is the speed with which he has captured the imaginations of millions who had given up on hoping for the church at all. People weary of the endless parsing of sexual ethics, the buck-passing infighting over lines of authority when all the while (to borrow from Milton), \u201cthe hungry Sheep look up, and are not fed\u201d. In a matter of months, Francis has elevated the healing mission of the church \u2013 the church as servant and comforter of hurting people in an often harsh world \u2013 above the doctrinal police work so important to his recent predecessors.\" It goes without saying that many have not just turned around and changed, but to estimate the extent of pushback and evaluate opposition seems to me to be a topic for another article: this is simply an article on his theology, regardless of what people think of it.

It also involves proxy conflicts in countries that aren't wars, like in Bahrain. I realize that it's been referred to both as a \"proxy conflict\" and a \"proxy war\" depending on the source, but the Saudi Arabia-Iran situation itself is a state of conflict, not a proxy war. The list of proxy wars article (although imperfect) acknowledges this with separate entries for each war that falls within the scope of the Saudi-Iran conflict.

It is possible CADW means another Maddox, George Vaughan was from a family of architects, but even then CADW's attribution doesn't follow John Newman, or any of the traditional sources I'm aware of.It would be very interesting to know the source for CADW's claim.

, {"id":"798729993","text":"Well, not wanting to be presumptuous, given that you took it to GA and most of the text's yours but......! Two approaches immediately strike me as possible. Either, we keep its current, chronological, structure, and divide the work that way; say \"Earliest times to the last of the Herberts\" and \"The Butes to the Present Day\". Or, we follow the approach for Castell Coch and do a \"History\" followed by an \"Architecture\", and split it that way. I've a preference for the latter - just because, I think it would make for a better, clearer, article - but very happy for it to be your call. I think it's pretty comprehensive, well-cited, and well-sourced as it stands. You'll know better than me whether the historical/military sources need refreshing. I don't think there's that much I'd add to the Burgesian architectural sources, although the coverage could be considerably expanded, particularly if we followed the Coch, room-by-room, approach. There's probably about six that would merit detailed coverage; the Clock Tower, the Hall, The Library, The Arab Room, Bute's Bedroom. Then there's the Roman and faux-Roman bits, the Keep, the Animal Wall and the Park, and, of course, all of the pre-Burges architecture that sits under his additions. I think its current size will easily allow for expansion - it's just over half the size of Windsor Castle. It's stable, apart from the occasional, \"it belongs to the people of Cardiff\" debate. Its images could be improved a bit, I think, but Commons is stuffed with them. As to workload, happy to follow your lead - although obviously my knowledge, and my sources, are stronger in relation to the Victorian castle. I could certainly ask Dr Blofeld, if you wanted to spread the load a bit more, although I'm not sure he does FA these days and I don't know how much time you've got available. But, all in all, I think an expansion, with a refresh, then PR, followed by FAC looks very attainable. And it could be fun - I suspect it might generate a fair bit of interest and debate!

The expectation that the interactions and behaviours of both directly involved parties would not be evaluated, in any form of mediation or binding process, is almost exclusively a Wikipedia expectation. The impracticality of one-sided evidentiary evaluation being the main reason. Predictions about the community during the case are not being validated by the results, so far, or by what we saw at the case request. The initial scope was intentionally narrowed so that one party would be reviewed broadly on ADMINACCT and the other exclusively in their interactions with the other party.:As for your involvement, that is entirely up to you. If the parties involved are not willing to participate in the arbitration process we have, then I see very little point on drawing others in. Mkdw talk "}
, {"id":"798438787","text":"No apology is necessary although I do appreciate the gesture. The case should have gone ahead without that guarantee. There had been some discussion about whether dispute resolution could proceed because it was filed by a third-party. It is often a requirement that a directly involved and affected party bring forward the grievance themselves. We do not observe the same requirement here on Wikipedia, for the time being, and as a result, we will run into systemic problems like this one."}
