First, the \"event function\" (the d(x,y) distance function) is interpolated using a polynomial. This is done by augmenting the ODE of the system by adjoining differential equations for the distance functions. Then the RK integrator gives a dense output, consisting of a polynomial which interpolates the true solution (including the event function) over the time interval. Third, the roots of this polynomial over the time interval are found using Sturm sequences (I do something similar, but I use the [WIKI_LINK: Durand-Kerner method] instead.) Finally, the exact zero of the distance functions are found by running a Newton-Raphson rootfinding algorithm on the (nonpolynomial) distance functions, and using the roots found by the Sturm sequence algorithm as initial guesses. The overall algorithm is compared to LSODAR, which is a black-box numerical integrator that includes event handling. By comparison, LSODAR apparently uses a variant of the secant method and bisection method, as does MATLAB's ODE suite (see [WIKI_LINK: Brent's method].) The black-box algorithms can sometimes be faster, but part of the point of the Grabner paper is that the interpolation method more reliably catches the first event in a time interval. Apparently, they found that for 25+ spheres, LSODAR works 20-30% slower than their algorithm.", "timestamp": "2007-06-19 18:05:05 UTC", "status": "just added", "page_title": "Talk:Collision detection", "user_text": "Loisel", "parent_id": "139239659.4319.4319"}},

The 2006 table there is pretty standard, so it's a good template to use - the only unusual thing is that usually all the sources are listed at the bottom of the page rather than the bottom of the table. As SA has no Coalition your job will be much easier, as you won't need to worry about having (Lib) and (Nat) after every Coalition candidate. (Still a big one, but these are among my personal favourites to make.) There's a lot of patience involved, too. Step one is to decide on title headers. I'd say for SA the only ones you'd need at this stage are ALP, Lib, Greens and Family First - there's no one else we can guarantee will run in a sufficient number of seats to earn a column to themselves (except maybe the Democrats). Looking at 2006, the Democrats should at least move further to the right of the table, as the Greens and Family First are definitely more important to the election. Then it's on with the show. I personally find it easier to type the tables rather than the back-spacing, but that's a personal preference. I also tend to have a linked party name on the clipboard (i.e. copy and paste), but if you're doing the backspacing thing that's not so important.

I removed \"he was opposed to using the vaccine on school children and instead advocated the use on teachers.\" He did not seriously advocate its use on teachers. In fact, he didn't advocate it at all. Rather, he asked the rhetorical question \"why don't we give this vaccine to teachers?\" I think the listener is supposed to infer something about the vaccine not being all that safe and adults being less willing to give informed consent, or something. I removed the sentence \"The vaccine is approved by the FDA and only works before sexual activity begins\" for two reasons. Here, Wikipedia is being placed in the position of answering Schlafly's argument. The fact that it's a really good answer is irrelevant. It's not our job to participate in debates.

It is already known that a particular Y-DNA haplogroup cannot be correlated with any particular mtDNA haplogroup on such a wide scale, because researchers have not yet identified sufficiently specific subclades. Take, for instance, the case of Y-DNA [WIKI_LINK: Haplogroup C (Y-DNA)@Haplogroup C]: one subclade of Haplogroup C, namely [WIKI_LINK: Haplogroup C3 (Y-DNA)@Haplogroup C3], is the modal Y-chromosome haplogroup among [WIKI_LINK: Mongols]; the overwhelming majority of mtDNA sequences among the Mongols belong to subclades of [WIKI_LINK: Haplogroup M (mtDNA)@Haplogroup M]. Another subclade of Haplogroup C, namely Haplogroup C4, is the modal Y-chromosome haplogroup among [WIKI_LINK: indigenous Australians]. However, close to 100% of indigenous Australian mtDNA haplotypes belong to various Australian-specific subclades of [WIKI_LINK: Haplogroup N (mtDNA)@Haplogroup N]. So, in the case of the Mongols, Y-DNA Haplogroup C is correlated strongly with mtDNA Haplogroup M, but in the case of the Australian aborigines, Y-DNA Haplogroup C is correlated even more strongly with mtDNA Haplogroup N. We cannot draw unfounded associations between particular Y-DNA and mtDNA haplogroups at the present level of phylogenetic resolution. I would bring up the case of Y-DNA [WIKI_LINK: Haplogroup R1b (Y-DNA)@Haplogroup R1b1c] as a case in point: it has recently been discovered that a great percentage of the Haplogroup R1b1c Y-chromosomes found among the [WIKI_LINK: Basque people] belong to either of two primarily Basque-specific subclades, R1b1c4 or R1b1c6. The majority of R1b1c Y-chromosomes found among other modern Western European populations are much more closely related to Haplogroup R1b1c9 Y-chromosomes that appear to derive from the ancestral population of the [WIKI_LINK: German people] or to Haplogroup R1b1c7 Y-chromosomes that are common among the [WIKI_LINK: Irish people] and [WIKI_LINK: Scottish people]. The crux of the matter is that every subclade has its own history. You need to respect this fact and defer composition of a table of associations between various Y-DNA and mtDNA haplogroups to a future time when the human Y-chromosome and mitochondrial DNA phylogeny has been determined to a sufficient degree of resolution.", "timestamp": "2007-01-20 05:49:29 UTC", "status": "just added", "page_title": "User talk:HalfOfElement29", "user_text": "Ebizur", "parent_id": "101950497.10.10"}, "101953012.886.886": {"id": "101953012.886.886", "comment_type": "COMMENT_ADDING", "content": " If you could not tell, I am already well aware of the difficulties in matching y-haplogroups and mt-haplogroups.

He was a cordial gentleman and answered uninhibitedly about his knowledge of Spanish and how the song was named.  I guess this constitutes \"original research\", which, according to the policies of Wikipedia, is not appropriate for its articles.  In other words, Wiki prefers to cite an authoritative _published_ source, rather than things like \"personal communication\".  All this inspires me to think about publishing something on it, so that Wiki will have a source to refer to. His letter was written in what I as a professor would call \"B-minus\" Spanish.  In quoting from it, I will give my English translation.  The source was indeed the (fictional) Italian slogan from \"The Barefoot Contessa\", as stated in the Wiki article.  \"My colleague, Mr. Livingston, was very impressed with the film and noted this phrase as a possible song title; only he [!] translated [it] into Spanish because this language seemed better for a hit song.\"  When they were assigned to write a song for \"The Man Who Knew Too Much\", Hitchcock suggested it be a song with a title in a foreign language, and of a sort that a mother might sing to her child.  \"We immediately [thought of] the title 'Que Ser\u00e1 Ser\u00e1' and wrote the song that won us an Oscar....\" For what it's worth, he consistently puts an accent on \"Ser\u00e1\" but not on \"Que\".  The sheet-music cover that I've seen on line has the title in ALL-CAPS  which, for many typesetters in Spanish, makes accent marks optional. As the Wiki article states, \"Qu\u00e9 ser\u00e1 ser\u00e1\" is ungrammatical in Spanish, at least as an expression of \"what will be will be\".  Native-speakers have told me they hear the line as the question \"\u00bfQu\u00e9 ser\u00e1?\" (\"What will it be?\" or \"What's gonna happen?\"), with the verb simply echoed to fit the music (compare \"Mary had a little lamb, little lamb,...\").", "timestamp": "2010-04-22 15:34:48 UTC", "status": "content changed", "page_title": "Talk:Que Sera, Sera (Whatever Will Be, Will Be)", "user_text": "Kotabatubara", "parent_id": "357505060.6833.6833"}},

If it continues in the vein I have seen, I will likley seek to have you barred from further participation on the article. Here are some notes on things you could do to improve your editing. 1. You need to seek consensus for changes that may be controvercial, as opposed to merely making those changes and hoping that they are either missed or that they are protected by the 1rr probation the article is under. There are a number of ways you could do this - you could propose your changes on the talk page and then wait for many comments, specifically looking for comments from people that have problems with your edits, correcting the problems they have, and then resoliciting their opinion. Another option is to make the changes you would like to the article, but expressly state that any editor may revert them, or that you would revert them on demand. 2. Blogs are never acceptable sources. If the only source you can find for something is a blog, it should never be included in an article. If you are sure something is true - it's not. You need a source for all information you intend to put in the article. 3. You should \"write for the enemy\" - when you are making an edit, be sure you know what the response from people who are traditionally on the other side of the debate from you would think of it, and make specific consessions to what problems you would expect them to have with it. 4. Edit summaries should be accurate. If you are reverting, note that. If you are making multiple changes, don't just mention one change and hope the rest go under the radar.

I don't have any plans of putting a lot of effort into this article; I would suggest that it would be improved by someone finding and citing sources on both sides of this controversial issue, which, as I understand it, has been somewhat exacerbated by the Turkish government's at times favoring those Zaza who do not identify as Kurds.   |", "timestamp": "2006-01-20 05:30:44 UTC", "status": "just added", "page_title": "Talk:Zazas", "user_text": "Jmabel", "parent_id": "35550517.2200.2188"}, "36711422.2690.2690": {"id": "36711422.2690.2690", "comment_type": "COMMENT_ADDING", "content": " :: I want to emphasis that we should use only reliable sources.

For example, until late 90\u2019s Turkish state universities published articles to prove Zazas are actually Turks.  Recently, a professor named Victoria Arakelova from Yerevan University, Armenia claims that most of the Zazas are Armenians.  She had several presentations in the USA and Europe to prove that.

In case we haven't seen enough strategies ... I'm hoping this one synthesizes many of the ideas, values and approaches that different people have brought to the project  plus make good use of the multitude of Wikipedians. Essentially, I'm thinking we could set up something roughly like [WIKI_LINK: WP:FAC]. People would nominate articles or lists for inclusion. The community would consider each entry's quality and relative importance, and the community would decide whether to include the entry in the release version. And for subsequent release versions, the community would also decide whether an entry should be removed or replaced. To guard against deterioration, at least the date of the qualification should probably be recorded. We would set an eligibilty threshold, which would gradually lower. Possible thresholds include FA, FL, GA, core topics, countries. And then when we get enough entries, we proceed to publish. I'm biased, but I'm excited about this. :You know, Maurreen, I'm surprised we didn't think of this earlier!  I think it sounds like an excellent idea, well done! We will be contacting all the WikiProjects again soon, should we say, \"Which articles in your subject area should be on the CD?\" I think I would like to decide on a publication DATE, since people are used to the idea that WP1.0 is at some point indefinitely in the future, perhaps years away.  If we said that we wanted to catch the Christmas market by having a cutoff for entries by (say) Friday, September 1, 2006, I think people would focus their attention on it more.  We would have ask them to nominate a specific version of each article, too, and perhaps ask them to update it if necessary right before the cutoff date.  Your criteria sound excellent, though I would add another, namely \"importance.\"  Our first release is likely to be 2000 or so, so we don't have room for fancruft and the like - though I think bigger releases should include some fancruft and roadcruft if the quality is there. ::Thank you.

I think we would look silly if (for example) we had [WIKI_LINK: Starfleet ranks and insignia] (a former FAC) included but we didn't include [WIKI_LINK: Science fiction].  Despite that, my dream is to see a WP release that includes both.  I agree that importance (like \"notability\") is in the eye of the beholder, but I think we will be in a better position to judge that once we have contacted the WikiProjects a second time to get their lists of most important topics, and we have put together some trees to go beneath the [WIKI_LINK: Wikipedia:Version 1.0 Editorial Team/Core topics/Tree@core topics tree].  I do think a deadline is a good thing, because we are going to need a cutoff point to go to press anyway.  If we have 2000 articles together and organised - sure, we can wait a week and get 2050 articles, but that will growth never end.  We should have a proposed cutoff date, and once we have everything organised for publication and we are just adding more articles we can make that date (or a later one) a firm date.

If Hanuman Das would agree to remove the contemporary words of Sivaya Subramuniyaswami, would you agree to remove the references to Sivaya Subramuniyaswami. The reason I suggest this is to make the site respectable to those who simply want to know the most scholarly impartial sources. For instance if you check Brytanica it does not quote contemporary gurus. This winds up looking like (even if it isn't) plugs for various masters and gives the appearance of NPOV. Traditional sources from the traditions, such as the The Kularnava Tantra (XIV/65) already quoted in the article are great. And we can give various root traditions under headings  Buddhist, Vedantic, etc. I know this will hurt, but it needn't. You can still put all the quotes you like on the Sivaya Subramuniyaswami and help you defend and improve that site. This is all fact as this is the beliefs of this guru and his followers, so its POV can't be chanllenged. Then when you mention the word \"satguru\" or Sat Guru as you have it, it will link to a reputable article grounded in tradition and will not appear to be a circular contrivance of followers of Sivaya Subramuniyaswami. So it actually increases his credibility founded in ancient traditions and not self-generated. Do you see? Please let me know soon. I do not want to see happen to this site what has happened to some guru sites  all the arguments over POV that you and others have suffered. So I implore you.

Please email me at chrisott1@cox.net and explain what is going on. I have also asked Hanuman to email me as he does not want to discuss this on his page. What I would like is an agreement to desist from quoting contemporary satgus on the page for satgurus. This should be confined to their pages. This should not drift over into sub-sites that are scholarly works on vedantic traditional terms. Scholars want to know the source of the traditions and terms, not about current debates over what he said and she said among all the modern gurus. It would be better that the site for satguru be short than a place of contention over contemporary living sources.

[WIKI_LINK: Harvey Bialy] is primarily a biologist, so it has been possible for me to do as you mentioned above, incorporating material from AIDS Wiki into a Wikipedia article. But this is not the case here, unless, of course, you don't mind gads of HIV/AIDS stuff in the content of the article here.)

It's entitled Sillybonkers.'' It's about a brown labrador, a tabby cat, and a wolf. They are taken to somewhere in the USSR in circa 1992, somewhere cold and dreadful, where an idiotic scientest named Professor Boskov Mikahloshkotov, tries to turn them into deadly assassins, but... They end up being three goofy animals. The labrador is obnoxious and yet very crazy, the cat is somewhat intellegent and calm, and the wolf is addicted to anything edible or drinkable and is screwed up in the head. Boskov hates his experiments. To humiliate them, he names the labrador, Sillybonkers, and controls his mind so he keeps that name. He calls the cat, Wackno. And the wolf, Ajax. Then he tries to kill them. However, they escape and must find their place in the world. The first 10 episodes focus on them living in the Big Apple (New York City), and then to upstate New York, like in the woods. Episode 11 to 30 will have them in California and other places in the west. After season one, they go worldwide. I think episode 51 (season 2 premiere) will have them in somewhere in the UK.

Since you're going around insisting that every article about every band that's appeared on the show must have a link to the show article in it, it makes it appear as if your agenda on Wikipedia is to promote the show. This is a red flag for spam. See [WIKI_LINK: WP:SPAMMER]: \"Adding the same link to many articles. The first person who notices you doing this will go through all your recent contributions with an itchy trigger finger on the revert button. And that's not much fun.\" Also, \"Contribute cited text, not bare links.\" The manner in which you've been jumping from article to article adding unnecessary \"TV appearances\" sections because you believe it's \"of INTEREST TO FANS\" makes you appear like a spammer, even if that's not your intention. In the article about the show, it's probably appropriate to link to the articles of the acts that have performed on it. However, it's extraneous to add links to the show to every one of those articles. Bands appear on TV shows all the time, after all. When you repeatedly insist that this particular link has to be in there simply because you say it does, it doesn't lead others to [WIKI_LINK: WP:AGF@assume good faith] on your behalf. [EXTERNAL_LINK: Threatening to take it to arbitration] also doesn't reflect well on you, especially since you haven't tried to discuss the issue on the article's talk page (or on my talk page, since I've been the one reverting you).

Why would an article include every instance of a band's recorded audio career and neglect to include a pertinent instance of a band's audio/visual career? - Perhaps a performance on letterman or leno goes unreferenced, this I understand.  But a one-hour feature concert exclusive, the only thing of its kind in that band's ouevre deserves to be referenced no more or less then every example from a band's discography.  In fact, I would make the case that an appearance on a show like Beautiful Noise is more interesting and important then most of the discography's included in entirety on many, many artist pages. You write \"Bands appear on TV shows all the time, after all\" - really?  How many full length concert series are on TV?

But it is not possible to identify everything someone might do to deliberately try to wreak havoc on Wikipedia. For this reason, no enforcement whatsoever has been set up against trolls.

Biased editing, even if defended aggressively, is in itself not trolling. By themselves, misguided nominations, votes, and proposed policy are not trolling. They are only trolling when they are motivated by a program of malice rather than ignorance or bias. This requires a judgment of the personal motivation for another's action. Such a judgment can never be made with anything approaching certainty. This fact should always be kept in mind when one is tempted to label someone a troll. Pay note, carefully!

I have to admit thought, that to date, that I do not encourage my students to use Wiki in their research, or if they use it that they go far far beyond it and that it should be used in any way that requires a citation.  Part of the reason for that is not knowing who writes the articles.  Granted the policies are meant to keep from people from such obvious fabrications as \"Black is White and Up is Down\" but as any wordsmith knows, the right word here or there can slant an article.  Or the selective use of sources that spin a particular bias.  The entries on Islam in Indonesia had this kind of problem.  Knowing who wrote allows me to assess the bias that might be present.  I know that the commmunity editing process is supposed to correct these sort of problems but the horrid pesantren article has been up for over a year.  It is not as bad as say the dictionary.com defintion of pesantren as terrorist institution a POV that I will need to address in the article  or course, Ithe only source that I know that deals withit at all is my own book but I do not tackle the question 100% head on.", "timestamp": "2007-02-20 11:36:13 UTC", "status": "just added", "page_title": "User talk:Dr. Lukens-Bull", "user_text": "Dr. Lukens-Bull", "parent_id": "109534285.4925.4925"}, "109536343.5637.5637": {"id": "109536343.5637.5637", "comment_type": "COMMENT_ADDING", "content": " A bigger problem is the lack of sources in many of the Indonesia articles.

The wording in your version blurs the distinction between possible different meanings, & thus blurs the possible distinction between the Buddha's original teaching & later periods of PSB. * The statement that the 1st schism occurred between the 2nd & 3rd councils is false in the sense that it is not a fact in the WP sense but a theory held by most scholars, as I've stated in my version, but not all. I cite scholars who disagree or question. * The concept of PSB itself (not the term, which is a separate discussion) is questionable. Schopen questions the idea that there was ever a period of unified Buddhism before it split into schools. He suggests (I don't think he's positively asserting) that Buddhism started out very diverse, & then gradually coalesced into a limited number of schools. I agree he's not entirely clear, but that's no justification for censoring his views. Of course my additions confuse things. That's the whole point.

Therefore it is appropriate that they be discussed in depth. This includes the reasons why cults may not be responsible, as well as who says that they are. The media attention given to this hypothesis alone makes it worthy of inclusion in a significant section. 4) Cults have also been shown to have committed large animal mutilations in Europe for decades, but not in the US, it is therefore important to discuss the similarities and differences of these cases. Particularly as it impacts significantly on public opinion (again, as 'animal mutilation' redirects to 'cattle mutilation' this seems an appropriate place to highlight the issue). 5) This page deals with both natural and unnatural mutilations (Predators, perverts and UFOs). It is therefore important that natural and unnatural be given equal weight, and that distinctions be drawn where they exist (eg horse ripping V horse/cattle mutilation and human mutilation V Muti killing). 6) Unmarked helicopters and aircraft were clearly associated with cattle mutilation by witness statements given to the FBI, and are therefore a viable part of mutilation folklore/fact.

You left the section about Lady the horse in. as well as the foreword about sheep and horese being mutilated, so it must be relevent that other animals suffer the same thing. 2) How, exactly, do you suggest that I verify something that is part of an unexplained phenomena? The best that I can do is to find proof that people believe that there are links and then show the reasons why they believe this. 3) The PP were near identical to the cattle mutilations, except not with cattle.

The anti-cult arguments are all valid. If you feel that it is out of balance, then YOU need to ADD some pro-cult.

Your explanation for this dubious tag, such as it was, was in your edit summary. I have two requests of you. First, could you please stop solely providing explanations for controversial edits in your edit summaries?  This practice is an unnecessary trigger to edit-warring, as someone who disagrees with you is going to be tempted to respond with an edit summary of their own, saying so  and that will require them reverting you.  Really, reading the discussion of editorial issues should not require a reader to look at both the article's talk page  and the article's contribution history, to see the edit summaries.  Reconciling which edit summaries were responses to which substantive comments in the talk page is an unnecessary burden.  If the explanation for the edit is more than a phrase, or a link to a policy page or previous discussion, it really belongs on the talk page, not in the edit summary.  If the edit or explanation is controversial, the explanation really belongs on the talk page. I am sorry the documentation for the  tag isn't clearer.  When instantiated the dubious tag provides two links.  The second link \"discuss\", will take the reader to where the tag placer has initiated a discussion of whatever they consider dubious.  So, if you had put {{dubious|Guilt by association?}}, when instantiated clicking on the \"discuss\" link would try to take the reader to [WIKI_LINK: Talk:Sajeel Shahid#Guilt by association?].  Of course you would also have the responsibility to have created a subsection entitled \"Guilt by association?\"  but you should already have done that  rather than follow a practice that is a trigger to edit-warring. I request you try your best to avoid leaving edit summaries that could serve to trigger edit warring, in so far as you are able.  I request that when you use the  tag, you use it in a manner where the \"discuss\" link takes the reader to an actual discussion of your concern. Thanks! Yours for more collegial collaboration...

Now, that's a lot of money invested in Montenegro's tourism. You also may realize that Montenegro, though equal in rights in every way, was only paying 5% of the Federal budget. That doesn't sound to me like a country that was oppressed by Greater Serbian Ideology, if anything, they were benefiting from it (if we assume that Greater Serbian ideology has anything to do with this, although I don't think it does). Lastly, Serbs and Montenegrins have so much in common, that it's impossible to tell each other apart. Putting an international borderline between the two states is also putting a border between the peoples, in a metaphorical sense. Unity? You support unity, you say? And yet you are happy that the UNION between Serbia and Montenegro disintegrated...

The St.Helens canal referred to, is actually the St.Helens Branch, an extra length of canal built some eighteen years after the Sankey Canal first opened, joining St.Helens to the Sankey Canal. The Ordnance Survey may refer to the St.Helens canal on their maps due to assumption, caused by their reference to personally opinionated writings, like Wikipedia has become. You, yourself, only know what you have read, and that is 'St.Helens Canal', and so do a lot of other people, worldwide. Until the true facts are shown, people all over the world, who know no better, will all believe the wrong information. The same thing happens with much more important matters than the name of a canal, due to people believing what they read, without question. I disagree strongly with your comment ... \"It is more important to be verifiable than it is to be correct\".  Also, American English is gramatically different to English, so please refrain from correcting script which is only wrong by opinion. Please take a look at a site by some local enthusiasts, the 'Sankey Canal Restoration Society', [EXTERNA_LINK: http://www.scars.org.uk]  Some of the things they say on there are, again, not true fact but are very close.

Permission was granted and was titled the Sankey Navigation Act. On it's opening, the name was changed to Sankey Canal as it was constructed alongside the Sankey Brook instead of along the same course. These facts are historically recorded. I can appreciate your belief in the O.S. but, unfortunately, they are WRONG in this case. You see, people will always believe what they read, thinking it is fact. The Sankey Canal is claimed to be the first canal in Britain on many sites, however it was not. The Bridgewater Canal is also claimed to be the first canal in Britain, again it is not. But people believe these things, simply because they are repeatedly given the same, wrong, information. Wikipedia is FULL of false facts and cannot be taken seriously. I have tried to put these right, but only what I KNOW is right, ie. articles about my immediate area. I wouldn't attempt to try to tell YOU anything about Seattle, as I have never been there and know nothing about the place.

After a manual advocating assasination that he was responsible for (because he was the head of the progam) surfaced, there was a scandal or 'flap' about it. Thus, he needed help from North, who was also involved in Contra affairs, to help him secure a job at the NSC.

Reagan moved the Contra program from the CIA (where it was now illegal) to the NSC (where it wasn't).

I started some tentative work on the Mettoy-Corgi article.  For my tastes, it has far too much detail about individual models  yet misses major aspects of the history of the brand!  but I  thought I have to start somewhere, and since it has been \"tagged\" for over a year now, I might as well just slowly start to go at it.  So I began by adding a few subheadings (before they were added, was almost impossible to read).  A few days later, somebody then added the following tag to the article:  \"This article may need to be wikified to meet Wikipedia's quality standards\" etc. etc.\" Can you state, in plain English, what that means?  I tried to look it up but find the Wiki help pages rather... ummm... well, let's say circumlocutious. I also have a few questions about the original tagging.  As I said, it is officially \"tagged\" as an article that needs cleanup work.  How does this happen?  What does it mean?  What does one need to do to get it \"back on track\"?  Whom does one need to contact to have it reviewed?  And why is there no indexing aside from \"pages needing cleanup\" etc.?

You remember how I wanted to change it from \"Matchbox (toy company)\" to \"Matchbox (toys)\", which I did.  Now somebody else changed it to \"Matchbox Toys\".

Believe me, I am not \"being sensitive because somebody changed something I wrote\" or anything like that.  I welcome improvements.  But this is, again I believe, a case of incorrect facts.  There is no trademark \"Matchbox Toys\".  (As opposed to some of their competitors' names, such as Dinky Toys, which is  as two'' words  a trademark.)  Thus I feel it is factually incorrect to have the article under the name \"Matchbox Toys\". How does one go about solving a situation like this?

Sources below) gave the sith order detailed background.  It recounted how the Sith order was a Manichean partner to the Jedi order that had fought many battles with it in ages prior to the rise of the first Galactic Empire. Several thousand years before the battle of Yavin, the order took it's final form with exactly two members at any time, master and apprentice, both titled \"Darth\". The final two were Senator/Emperor Palpatine, Darth Sidious and Darth Vader, AKA Anakin Skywalker. The Sith use negative emotions such as anger, confusion, and fear to achieve mastery of their victims and advance the Dark Side. In the Revenge of the Sith there are two scenes in which the final Sith are revealed as having turned to the dark side. The first occurs when Palpatine tells Anakin that Sith teachings can save Padme from the death he, Anakin, has foreseen in childbirth. Anakin recognizes him then as a Sith and draws his light saber. The second scene is when Darth Vader confronts Obi Wan in their duel on Mustafar and he says to Obi Wan that all the Jedi are corrupt. Obi Wan says that \"only a Sith deals in absolutes\" and recognizes Anakin as one and draws his light saber.", "timestamp": "2007-10-14 04:19:01 UTC", "status": "content changed", "page_title": "User talk:Lycurgus", "user_text": "Lycurgus", "parent_id": "164432047.2267.2267"}, "164433228.2972.2972": {"id": "164433228.2972.2972", "comment_type": "COMMENT_ADDING", "content": " See also my POV WP \u00a7.", "timestamp": "2007-10-14 04:22:24 UTC", "status": "just added", "page_title": "User talk:Lycurgus", "user_text": "Lycurgus", "parent_id": "164432047.2267.2267"}},

At that time, there was a list or table of countries, indicating their English usage and the expectation was that articles concerning the country would use that English: American or British.  I believe Cuba, Mexico, maybe South American countries were shown as using American English, but I don't remember.  I have no idea where that list went to now, but it seemed reasonable to me then and now as a necessary compromise.  What I now can see when looking at various category trees is that where there is a British/American spelling difference, only the US categories get the American English (maybe grudgingly at that) while all the other countries get British English.  This may not be done so much by British English pushers as is done by those pushing WP name uniformity to override any and all other concerns to have names match the local English in use.  Except for the US itself, the uniformity argument nearly always winsthere is really no standing or acceptance for the local argument.  There is also the case that when we get to the international level, then it is a majority count.  With all of Europe and all the former British colonies and really all countries but the US, then at the international level categories, the choice is always British.  Now if this were a British WP, all of this would not be problem, but this is supposed to be an English WP.  The consequence may be (absolutely no way to demonstrate this) is that American English readers will be turned off and then tune out.  For better or for worse, many people like things that are familiar to them; other things, not familiar, are more suspect, foreign, not 'us' but 'them'.  If my suggested consequence is true, the current situation and direction is surely not a good thing for WP, with some Americans just dropping out.  Another example of where this relentless uniformity logic goes, trying to override all that is local can be found at [WIKI_LINK: Wikipedia talk:Naming conventions (geographic names)#RFC: United States cities], where is seems non-US editors are trying to impose their views (and show their lack of knowledge) on a US local situation.

However, I think the \"lowest MetaCritic rating ever\" mention goes too far.  At best, it's trivia, and at worst, it's a blatant attempt to \"pile on\" and paint the show in the worst possible light.

As you say plenty of first team regulars have matches with the reserves and until now I wouldn't have thought that they had left the first team (especially if they have played only a few matches for the reserves). Maybe we should ask at [WIKI_LINK: WP:FOOTY] if adding matches for reserve teams generally gives a wrong impression. As I understand it, the infobox should list all the apps and goals for the domestic league. This means for me for German domestic leagues the top three levels (which are professional). For some players the third level is the highest they ever play, so I think we agree that if a player was mainly playing for the reserves, matches should be counted. But then we have different standards for different players: The match of [EXTERNAL_LINK: FC Bayern Munich II against Jahn Regensburg] would count as match for [WIKI_LINK: Diego Contento] (who was playing for the reserves at that time) but not for for [WIKI_LINK: Luca Toni] and in my opinion this is not correct.", "timestamp": "2012-06-03 20:37:33 UTC", "status": "just added", "page_title": "User talk:TonyStarks", "user_text": "Jaellee", "parent_id": "495828744.14078.14078"}, "495975391.14575.14575": {"id": "495975391.14575.14575", "comment_type": "COMMENT_ADDING", "content": " : I've put the question up at [WIKI_LINK: WT:FOOTY#Matches for the reserve team in infobox@WT:FOOTY].

In this case, I found this when looking into the [WIKI_LINK: WP:ITN/C#Carbon] proposal to have a front page blurb about the 6 co-ordinate carbon structure reported in the dication of hexamethylbenzene.  I edit Wikipedia because I enjoy it and learn from it, and when I have started something I'll put effort into building it, but I don't always edit to build a systematic encyclopaedic article on a topic from the ground out.  I recognise that small additions here and there can lead to an overall UNDUE issue, which is why I appreciate others coming along and tweaking or even removing content.  I do appreciate you stopping by, happy to discuss editing.  I hope you can see and accept that my addition to zinc chloride is not what I might have done had I come to the article with the aim of expanding / developing content on zinc chloride, but I didn't come to write about zinc chloride in general but instead to add something interesting fitting within the existing content.  Had it been zinc chloride catalysing a thoroughly unexceptional reaction, like (say) the Friedel-Crafts ethylation of an activated benzene with EtCl / ZnCl2, then I would not have added it.  However, what I added offers an example of alkylation (which was not there) and an unusual building of a carbon skeleton.  I know that we don't want the interesting to crowd out the important, but that doesn't mean not including some of the interesting.  I don't think I have obscured the important, but you may disagree.  Anyway, having written too much, if you want to make changes, go for it.  I'm happy to say thanks when a change to what I have added results in an improvement to the encyclopaedia, and certainly an external perspective can see flaws more readily.

In this perspective, mountains, if they exist at all, are just the roofline of an orogen. In my mind, these authors are distancing orogeny from mountains. Mountains are there, but they are incidental. Then there is the quote from [EXTERNAL_LINK: PB King] in this account, and on the legend of the Tectonic Map of North America, \u201corogeny\u201d is therefore used for the processes by which the rock structures within the mountain chains or fold belts are created. This statement appears to require the presence of mountains, but orogeny refers to aspects of events surrounding the formation of rock structures in these mountains, not to the formation of the mountains per se. This statement is very close to the one by [EXTERNAL_LINK: Jackson & Bates]: By present geological usage, orogeny is the process by which structures within fold-belt mountainous areas were formed, including thrusting, folding, and faulting in the outer and higher layers, and plastic folding, metamorphism, and plutonism in the inner and deeper layers. This statement refers to rock-forming processes in mountainous areas, (and way, way beneath them) not to mountain building per se, and goes on to point out that: the deformation of rocks within the mountains, and the creation of the mountainous topography ... were mostly not closely related, either in origin or in time. So I have a spectrum of opinion ranging from a reference almost to plate tectonics itself onward to what is instead a catalog of possible processes that form rock structures. All statements distance orogeny from mountain building per se. I also find myself in my own reading that the usage of orogeny in the long detailed descriptions of specific orogens like [WIKI_LINK: Caledonian orogeny], [WIKI_LINK: Antler orogeny] & so forth agree with the above statements as to subject better than than they agree with the etymology of orogen. So, IMO there is a clear line of thought and sources that differs from what you two (Awickert & Vsmith) find to be common usage, indicating perhaps that multiple usages abound and should be clearly discussed and differentiated, eh?", "timestamp": "2010-02-06 07:09:16 UTC", "status": "content changed", "page_title": "Talk:Orogeny", "user_text": "Brews ohare", "parent_id": "342252045.6423.6402"}},

Untrue. Metal Gears are the \"star of the show\" - it's the center of nearly all of the games. How is that minor? It doesn't have as much importance as the characters, but it surely has importance.

Who knows why you want centered text, which any average design-student would strongly be against. Although there needs to be standards, and good ones, you've gone on the wrong track. The current \"standards\" don't cater for a lot of articles. Remember, it's not a \"bare-bones\" box. If directly-related articles exist, they're worth linking. If not, the articles should be deleted or merged. Of course I don't mean loosely-related articles like [WIKI_LINK: Hideo Kojima] should be linked, but [WIKI_LINK: Metal Gear (weapon)] should.

Even the [WIKI_LINK: British India] government held [WIKI_LINK: Bhumihar@ Bhumihar Brahmin]s to be [WIKI_LINK: Brahmin]s through a proper Tribunal. Then which some people'' are you talking about? All this only suggests that you and others who are deciding this issue in [WIKI_LINK: wikipedia] are anti-[WIKI_LINK: Bhumihar@ Bhumihar Brahmin]s. Your ten-twenty people whose academic qualifications cannot be ascertained are deciding on all this based on their own limited knowledge and baseless assumptions. And above all are biased and prejudiced. This is all what I can say. (2) The castes mentioned in Vishwakarmas come under [WIKI_LINK: Other Backward Classes] or such other reserved castes who are [WIKI_LINK: Constitution]ally held backward and therefore enjoying benefits of [WIKI_LINK: reservation]. You cannot compare them with a uniformly held upper-caste like [WIKI_LINK: Bhumihar@ Bhumihar Brahmin]s who are in the General category. (3) If somebody is not a [WIKI_LINK: Bhumihar@ Bhumihar Brahmin] in the list of [WIKI_LINK: Bhumihar@ Bhumihar Brahmin]s you remove that name but not having the list in the first place is prejudicial. And if it is a policy matter remove such lists of other communities as well. Having lists of all communities and not having for some reflects your double standards. If you follow such double standards [WIKI_LINK: wikipedia] will never gain [WIKI_LINK: academic] credibility.

One huge reason it really, really, REALLY bothers me is because those who want to ignore the Zak Penn interview completely are essentially discrediting and silencing one of the top authorities about this movie in favor of a technicality.  Frankly that's just scary.  Imagine that mentality applied to articles about more important issues. In a continuing effort to make it more accurate and neutral, I propose we at least list him as Quill/Kid Omega, and not just Kid Omega, followed by the existing sentence that clarifies that he is typically called Quill by those who matter and resembles Quill and not Kid Omega, but is listed as Kid Omega in the credits.  If that is allowed to take place then I will stop pressing the issue. (Of course if I ever come across Zak Penn or Ratner or the other writer explaining the situation on a real website and not a forum, I will not hesistate to change it completely over to Quill and explain that Kid Omega is a blatant error.  That should be obvious.) I won't change it now because, of course, someone will revert it immediately and I'm not in the mood for that.  By the way, here's a suggestion - if you have a problem with a part of an edit, fix what's wrong with it, rather than just reverting the entire page back to what it was and thus keeping it as incorrect as it was before the edit.  When people edit in good faith and some of what they say works, but you erase all of it in a knee-jerk reaction, it really makes them feel frustrated and like they're wasting their time. Please convincingly argue why an error in the credits is considered more valid than Ratner and his head writers.  And yes, it should already be assumed that the credits are in error, because they are.  The article itself may not be able to incorporate Penn's very clear explanation of this because it appears on a forum, but this isn't the article.  This is the talk page.

But, I believe the correct astronomical name for the Sun is just that  the Sun.  In astronomy, as I recall, the only use for the word \"sol\" is as a unit of time to denote a single Martian day.  The Romans did refer to our sun as Sol because that's Latin, of course, and it was the Roman equivalent of the Greek sun god, Helios.  Sol is commonly used in literature and other popular media as a name for our Sun, usually in science fiction where it is often necessary to avoid confusion with other stars.  (The name Luna is likewise often used as another name for the Moon.)  Perhaps the statement is simply referring to the name of the Sun as it is known within the fictional astronomy of the Doctor Who universe.  However, if that is the case, perhaps it could be rephrased to make that distinction clearer, as the reference contains a link to Wikipedia's article on real-world astronomy.

I stumbled across the American Dragon category while looking at an article that was in it, pulled it up and thought it looked very much like a number of other categories that have been deleted, thought that it was unnecessary as a navigational hub and thought that it would attract more articles on actors and crew if it remained. I guess my global rationale, such as it is, is that in my experience the vast majority of categories named for stuff like individual people, films or TV shows are not needed. Most of the categories named for people, especially those in the arts, hold the article on the person and the subcats for albums and songs. TV show and film categories tend to hold subcats for episodes and characters and the article for the show or film. All of this stuff is easily interlinked through the show's article and slapping it into a category strikes me as completely pointless, categorization for the sake of categorizing. Same goes for family categories. All that's in most of them are the articles on the individual family members. I'm a big believer in streamlining and having hundreds of categories that IMHO serve no purpose is not streamlined. Simplest is usually best and many of these category trees aren't simple and they aren't particularly functional. I don't spend a lot of time going out and looking for these things; it has just happened, as I mentioned previously, that in fairly short order I've found several similar trees and have been working through them.

He has claimed, falsely, at various points in time that (a) consensus does not matter, (b) the views of others do not matter, and, oddly enough, (c) that he was either following consensus or that there was no consensus in those cases where he is editing blatantly contrary to consensus. However, it's not his bizarre inconsistencies and idiosyncratic views that trouble me. It's the fact that he acts upon these idiosyncratic views with no concern for other editors, alternatively using blunt personal attacks, blatant dishonesty, subtle deception, and outright revert-warring to put those views into practice. Although Copperchair has claimed that he never knew what the consensus was regarding, say, the inclusion of Wedge Antilles in the credits for various Star Wars films, one of his own talk page links [11] shows that myself, A Link to the Past, and Clawson all agree Wedge should be included, which at least provides a rough consensus. The fact that Copperchair's attempts to add Wedge have been reverted, at various times, by just about all parties listed as \"Party 2\" in this RfAr and then some also demonstrates a consensus. As for Copperchair's assertions that \"we should follow the filmmakers\u2019 decision\" and that, in that respect, \"consensus is irrelevant\", Copperchair is demonstrating a severe disagreement with the policy of Consensus. Copperchair is of course free to disagree with some Wikipedia policies, so long as he does not violate those policies to the detriment of the community and the Wikipedia.", "timestamp": "2005-10-29 09:53:55 UTC", "status": "content changed", "page_title": "User talk:Copperchair", "user_text": "The Wookieepedian", "parent_id": "26779487.10670.10673"}},

Except what I changed came directly from the report. Here's what the referenced source says: \"In 1982, a phase II study with 175 patients looked at which types of cancer might benefit from treatment with amygdalin. Most of the patients in this study had breast, colon, or lung cancer. Amygdalin was given by injection for 21 days, followed by oral maintenance therapy using doses and procedures similar to those in the phase I study. Vitamins and pancreatic enzymes were also given as part of a metabolic therapy program that also included dietary changes. One stomach cancer patient showed a decrease in tumor size, which was maintained for 10 weeks while the patient was on amygdalin therapy. In about half of the patients, cancer had grown at the end of the treatment. Cancer had grown in all patients 7 months after completing treatment. Some patients reported an improvement in their ability to work or do other activities, and other patients said their symptoms improved. These improvements, however, did not last after treatment ended.\" This is what I wrote: \"A 1982 study found that while on Amygdalin therapy patients symptoms improved, though once taken off therapy the improvements didn't last. One patient's tumor decreased in size, and the rest either had no size change or increased.\" This is what's written: \"A 1982 trial of 178 patients found that tumor size had increased in all patients. Minimal side effects were seen except in two patients who consumed bitter almonds and suffered from cyanide poisoning.\" > Notice that the patients who consumed bitter almonds and had cyanide poisoning are not at all mentioned in the source. Perhaps it would be better to write: \"A 1982 trial of 175 patients found that while undergoing vitamin therapy and amygdalin injections, an improvement in symptoms was reported by some patients, while others reported that their ability to work or do other activities had improved. While on the therapy, one patients tumor mass decreased and approximately half had tumors increased in size. Seven months after therapy ended however, all patients tumors were found to have grown, and previous improvements reported did not last.\" My feeling on that is, (though not to be written in the article), isn't obvious that after treatment stops the disease will continue to grow? It seems it's less a indicator of the effectiveness of treatment but rather of the non-effectiveness of lack of treatment. Anyway, it seems obvious to me that the change is a nudge towards more accurate and neutral reporting, compared to what was previously written.", "timestamp": "2009-02-11 17:48:01 UTC", "status": "content changed", "page_title": "User talk:Aunt Entropy", "user_text": "Grizzedram", "parent_id": "270038795.30924.30924"}, "270070688.31872.31872": {"id": "270070688.31872.31872", "comment_type": "COMMENT_ADDING", "content": " :What you wrote is not what the report says.

I don't know of a Wiki convention, except that where there are two equally valid options (usually US or British English spellings/words), we should go with the original author. Pram is a good example. It's more a British term, but as this was the original word, we should not change it to an American one without good cause. I also have the view that when writing about American places we should use US terminology, but when writing about European subjects we should use British English. Why? Because 1) European countries are part of the EU which has (British) English as one of its official languages and 2) Europeans are more likely to use and be familiar with British English.

You removed the following for the reason \"It is utter garbarge\":Quantum evolution is the hypothesis that genetic mutation is adaptive, or directed through quantum effects.I quote from the back cover of the book \"Quantum Evolution - Life in the Multiverse\" by Johnjoe McFadden (a leading theorist in this area, and Professor at Surrey University - i.e. someone who knows more about this than you): : \"Living organisms are controlled by a single molecule - DNA. Yet Physics tells us that the behaviour of single molecules is controlled not by classical laws but by quantum mechanics. The implications of this for biology have never been fully explored. Until now. In this brilliant debut, Johnjoe McFadden puts forward a startling new theory of quantum evolution. He shows how quantum mechanics gives living organisms the ability to initiate specific actions including new mutations. Thus evolution may not be random at all but directed - cells may, in certain circumstances, be able to choose to mutate particular genes that provide an advantage in the environment in which the cell finds itself. This property of living organisms to direct their actions has startling implications. It must be at the root of both consciousness and free will: Quantum Evolution provides a new understanding of the origin of life and the meaning of death. Life, this brilliant book argues, is a quantum phenomenon. Quantum Evolution'' provides a new biology for the new millennium.\" Now although this is from the back cover (i.e. hype) it nevertheless reflects the current idea/hypothesis of what''' quantum evolution is/means.

The math wars really got into gear about the mid 1990s, and even the NCTM has backpedaled since 2000, culminating in the latest headlines which made nearly front page news on both the New York Times and Wall Street Journal. NCTM research and curriculum frameworks based on the 1989 standards are cited by nations around the world, including Korea, Australia and New Zealand. The biggest impact and one of the biggest sources of controversy over mathematics instruction is the elevation of topics and methods that were once completely outside the scope of mathematics instruction, such as diversity, writing, cutting, pasting, coloring and even singing (the teacher's manual to Investigations even comes with sheet music to Happy Birthday). Texts such as Investigations and Mathland do not even include formal direct instruction of many of the skills listed as being mathematics topics.  If you are not familiar with the extent of the controversy, I would suggest taking a quick look at Mathematically Correct and some of their reviews. Standards based texts generally get glowing reviews from promoters of  the standards, but reviews from consumers are rarely as positive, and often negative. If discussion of the controversy were restricted to education journals, then it might certainly be relegated to footnote background articles, but when it makes the front page of the New York Times and Wall Street Journal, and the policy of the most influential mathematics education standards organization in the United States, and therefore, the world, it is certainly  not a local issue. An issue which is essentially the only mathematics issue that gets front page coverage in contemporary newspapers certainly justifies similar coverage on the main wikipedia mathematics education article. Edits have been mode both expanding on the principles and motivation of standards based mathematics, as well as its critics. The influence of the 1989 standards is such that it remains the foundation of nearly every state curriculum framework, with states like California which have all but openly rejected those standards, and news stories of individual districts backing out or openly discarding standards-based curriculum showing a clear start of a movement away from the standards, even though  today they remain predominant in the US and in many other nations.  To only present the point of view of mathematics educators would be seriously unbalanced, as they are uniformly committed to the 1989 standards and are against a return to traditional teaching methods.
