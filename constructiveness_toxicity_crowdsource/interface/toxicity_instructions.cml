<h1><strong><span style="color: rgb(184, 49, 47);">Overview</span></strong></h1>

<p>In this job, you will be presented with headlines and opinion articles from the Canadian newspaper The Globe and Mail and real comments that people posted in response to these articles.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Your job is to&nbsp;</p>

<ol>
	<li>read the opinion article;&nbsp;</li>
	<li>read the corresponding comment; and&nbsp;</li>
	<li>answer the presented questions related to the <strong>toxicity</strong> of these comments using your intuitions and the guidelines provided below.&nbsp;</li>
</ol>

<p>If you are curious, we are interested in building computational systems to organize news comments in a meaningful way and your annotations will be used in building and evaluating such systems.&nbsp;</p>

<h1><span style="color: rgb(184, 49, 47);">Guidelines</span></h1>

<p><em>Toxic</em> comments are intended to cause harm. We ask you to rate toxicity on a 4-point-scale. Below we are providing some characteristics and examples of four levels of toxicity: very toxic, toxic, mildly toxic, and non-toxic comments. Note that these are just guidelines and not hard definitions. &nbsp;</p>
